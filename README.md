## Description
This project connects to two web services: OpenWeatherMap API and Xotelo API.

On one hand, the application interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data for any location worldwide. The application makes API calls every 6 hours to fetch the weather forecast for the next 5 days on the 8 Canary Islands, specifically at noon. Additionally, it establishes a connection with an ActiveMQ broker to transmit the obtained weather data, including temperature, probability of precipitation, humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed. This transmission is facilitated by the "prediction-provider" module.

On the other hand, the application also makes calls to the Xotelo API, which delivers real-time hotel or hostel pricing data. This lightweight API retrieves hotel rates based on TripAdvisor. The "reservation-provider" module is responsible for connecting to the Xotelo API and receiving hotel messages, which are then sent to a topic in an ActiveMQ broker.

The "data-lake-builder" module is designed to connect the application to the two topics created in the previous modules, containing hotel and weather data. Subsequently, the software receives the stored data from both topics and uses it to construct a data lake with the acquired information.

The "hoteladvisor-business-unit" creates a datamart by connecting to the topics in the broker that store hotel and weather data. Additionally, it incorporates the design of a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. The software provides the user with various lodging options based on the chosen island and date, in addition to displaying the meteorological conditions during their stay. The datamart generated by this unit is backed by an SQLite database.

### Execution

To execute the application, in the "prediction-provider" module, the user must add their personal apiKey as arguments to connect with the openweathermap API, along with the URL to connect with the broker.

In the "reservation-provider" module the user must add as an argument the url to conect to the broker.

The "datalake-builder" must receive as parameter the url to connect to the broker.

In the "hoteladvisor-business-unit" the user must add as parameters the url to conect to the broker and the path to create the sqlite database.

Every argument must be added in the order that has been detailded.

## Resources

  This project has been developed entirely using IntelliJ IDEA. IntelliJ IDEA is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created by JetBrains. JetBrains is a company that develops tools and solutions for software developers. IntelliJ IDEA is specifically designed for Java application development, although it also offers support for other programming languages such as Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, and more.

Throughout the project's development, the Git version control system has been used. Git is a fundamental tool for tracking changes in source code during software project development. All project versions are stored in the 'master' branch.

Regarding the procedure, the application establishes the connection with the API through the Jsoup library. Jsoup is a Java library that provides operations for working with HTML and XML. It allows for the extraction and manipulation of data, which can be conveniently used for our needs. 

This application relies in the broker concept, in particular in ActiveMQ. ActiveMQ is an open-source messaging system based on the Java Message Service (JMS) protocol. It operates as a message broker, enabling asynchronous communication between applications in a distributed network.

This software also uses JDBC for creating de database. JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. It is a Java-based API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases.
  
### Tools 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system for tracking changes in source code during software project development.
- [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/): Java library for working with HTML and XML, facilitating data extraction and manipulation
- [ActiveMQ]( https://activemq.apache.org): Open source, multi-protocol, Java-based message broker
- [JDBC](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc.html): Java based api to interact with relational data bases.

## Design

This project has been developed considering the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and its derivatives. The MVC pattern helps achieve high-level software, avoiding interdependence between its layers and promoting a high degree of modularity and cohesion.

In general terms, the MVC pattern divides the application into three main components:

Model: Represents the logic and data of the application.
View: Is responsible for the presentation and user interface.
Controller: Handles user interactions and coordinates actions between the model and the view.
Derivatives of the MVC pattern, such as MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVP (Model-View-Presenter), adapt the basic approach to address different needs and development contexts.

Below is the abstraction of the project through class diagram. These diagrams has been used as a guide throughout the development of the application.
